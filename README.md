Welcome to my task management application! Developed with enthusiasm and dedication, this project was created based on a YouTube tutorial by John Komarnicki.

With this application, you can efficiently organize your daily tasks and have complete control over your activities. Stay productive, prioritize your goals, and enjoy the satisfaction of completing your tasks.

The intuitive and user-friendly interface makes it easy to add new tasks.

Additionally, the application allows you to mark tasks as completed, update their statuses, and delete them when needed. This way, you'll always have a clear view of your progress and what still needs to be done.

Make the most of all the features offered by the application and make your routine more efficient and productive.
