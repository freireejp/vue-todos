    <p>
      Welcome to my task management application! Developed with enthusiasm and
      dedication, this project was created based on a YouTube tutorial by John
      Komarnicki.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this application, you can efficiently organize your daily tasks and
      have complete control over your activities. Stay productive, prioritize
      your goals, and enjoy the satisfaction of completing your tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intuitive and user-friendly interface makes it easy to add new tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the application allows you to mark tasks as completed,
      update their statuses, and delete them when needed. This way, you'll
      always have a clear view of your progress and what still needs to be done.
    </p>

      Make the most of all the features offered by the application and make your
      routine more efficient and productive.
